# Student Performance Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Python.
The goal is to understand how factors like study hours, sleep hours,
previous scores, and extracurricular activities affect student performance.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
- Student Performance Dataset (CSV file)
- Contains information such as:
  - Hours Studied
  - Previous Scores
  - Extracurricular Activities
  - Sleep Hours
  - Sample Question Papers Practiced
  - Performance Index

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
3. Explored data structure using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`
4. Checked for missing values and duplicates
5. Performed data analysis using:
   - GroupBy
   - Filtering
   - Aggregations
6. Derived insights from the data

## 📊 Key Insights
- Students with higher study hours tend to have better performance index
- Sleep hours and extracurricular activities show impact on performance
- Previous scores strongly influence final performance
